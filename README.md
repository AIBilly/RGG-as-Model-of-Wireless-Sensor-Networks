# RGG-as-Model-of-Wireless-Sensor-Networks
Designed and implemented a program to choose the locations of wireless sensors in a wireless sensor network.<br>
It consists of three main functions: Generating RGG (Random Geometric Graph), Coloring and Finding Backbones.<br>
And we can get the locations to set up wireless sensors from Backbones.<br>
Programmed and implemented with Qt and designed an easy-to-use UI.
